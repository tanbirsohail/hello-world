# hello-world
This is the proverbial hello-world repository.

It will contain intorductory information about me and my work. Also it will contain gist of all projects I have created and published in github.

## My Projects

* jupyter-notebooks - Contains my jupyter notebooks that I prepared for taking learning and practice notes while doing many MOOCs and turorials online. I will link and refer materials and citations in the readme. A good starting place for people who want a quick and "head-first" take on Jupyter Notebooks.
* data-science-study-guide - My self-study syllabus for data science and machine learning.
