# hello-world
This is the proverbial hello-world repository.

It will contain intorductory information about me and my work. Also it will contain gist of all projects I have created and published in github.

## My Projects

* **jupyter-notebooks** - Contains my jupyter notebooks that I prepared for taking learning and practice notes while doing many MOOCs and turorials online. I will link and refer materials and citations in the readme. A good starting place for people who want a quick and "head-first" take on Jupyter Notebooks.

* **data-science-study-guide** - My self-study syllabus for data science and machine learning. I also added free and paid resources that will come in handy. You may use these by following my plan or create your own self study plan.

* **exploring-popular-datasets** - Here I explore some of the most popular datasets used for learning ML. I will be using mostly scikit-learn and Numpy, Scipy or Matplotlib. This repo is intended for beginners who are getting started with Machine Learning.
